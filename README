Bridgette - an agnostic/dumb WebSocket to TCP bridge server

Bridgette is protocol indifferent and will pass messages back and forth between a connected websocket client and a tcp server. 
Built with Ruby event-machine and the em-websocket plugin.

For instance it could be used to forward between a web based chat client  and an IRC server.
